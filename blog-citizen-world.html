      <h2>✨What “Citizen of the World” Means to Me🌍</h2>

        I’ve never really felt like I belonged to just one place. Born in Venezuela, raised in the United States, now navigating life in Mexico, I’ve met people, lost people, gained languages, regained lost languages (lol), and now carrying stories across borders. “Citizen of the World” isn’t just a cute name — it’s who I am.
